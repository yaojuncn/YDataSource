This is a Java connection pool written for my own interest as a weekend project;
The goal is to provide a neat implemenation only doing connection pool management WITHOUT supporting xa, jca and so on;
current features:
* basic pool management with min, max, blocking timeout, query timeout, idle timeout
* support oracle & mysql exceptionsorter, which you can add error codes and behaviors in runtime

meantime, I hope to make it as fast as possible in the future.
